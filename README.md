# Every Day Learning
This repository has one purpose: Keep me motivated to learn one new thing every day. The goal is for every day for there to be a new commit with example and notes of me learning something new.

## Repository Structure
The basic structure for this repository is to break each category that I'm learning something new in into directories. Each of these directories will have their own directories for the thing I learned on that day. These will include a README with notes of what I learned and if applicable, will contain code examples.

This main README will include a list of everything in the order that it was done. So I can go back and view it day by day.
